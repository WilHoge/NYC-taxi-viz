The visualization I created allows the user to get aggregated information on the taxi trips and detailed insights into the origin/destination of the trips simultaneously.\r\n\r\n# Design\r\n\r\nThe visualization has two components. On the left side there is a chart showing the results of data aggregation. On the right side there is a map showing trip origins/destinations. The user will have the possibility to filter the data for both of the visualizations.\r\n\r\nindex1.html is the first version of the visualization.\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\nNYC taxi analysis is based on data found here: http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/. Only a small subset of the data is used for this visualization to demonstrate the concept.\r\n\r\nThe subsets to choose from have 1.000, 10.000 and 100.000 taxi trips:\r\n\r\n- taxi-av1000.csv\r\n- taxi-av10000.csv\r\n- taxi-av100000.csv","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
