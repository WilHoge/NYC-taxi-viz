# Summary

Taxi data from NYC is available for some time now (see http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/). The visualization I created allows the user to get aggregated information on the taxi trips and detailed insights into the origin/destination of the trips simultaneously.

# Design

The visualization has two components. On the left side there is a chart showing the results of data aggregation. On the right side there is a map showing trip origins/destinations. The user will have the possibility to filter the data for both of the visualizations.

index1.html is the first version of the visualization.

# Resources

NYC taxi analysis is based on data found here: http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/. Only a small subset of the data is used for this visualization to demonstrate the concept.

The subsets to choose from have 1.000, 10.000 and 100.000 taxi trips:

- taxi-av1000.csv
- taxi-av10000.csv
